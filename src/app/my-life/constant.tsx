      At PomoSuperFocus, we have tried to improve UI & UX, and made it more
      configurable. You can enter your birth date and your own estimate life
      span and we will show you accordingly, however - you can comeback and
      change estimate life span anytime.
      <br />
      <br />
      This gives individual - an awareness and importance of each day passing
      with visual statistics. We wish you - Good luck! We hope you make the best
      out of this life! 😎🏆
